    "title": "The New York Liberty Three-point Success Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The New York Liberty Dominate Three-point Shooting.\nOr at least… that’s what I thought.\nHeading into this analysis, I assumed the top team in the WNBA 2024 season had to be lights-out when it came to three-point shooting. The New York Liberty racked up wins, played with confidence, and looked unstoppable—but when I created a scatter plot comparing three-point percentage to win percentage across teams, the results surprised me. The Liberty were certainly winning, but their three-point shooting? Just barely above average. This finding challenged my assumptions and raised a bigger question: If it’s not the three-points then what’s actually driving their success?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nwnbadata &lt;- load_wnba_team_box(2024) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == 2)\n\nseasondata &lt;- wnbadata |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_threes_attempted = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted),\n    total_threes_made = sum(three_point_field_goals_made),\n    total_wins = sum(ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0))\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(total_three_point_pct = (total_threes_made/total_threes_attempted)*100) |&gt; \n  filter(total_threes_attempted &gt; 100)\n\nlibertyseasondata &lt;- seasondata |&gt;\n  filter(team_name == \"Liberty\")\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data=seasondata, aes(x=total_three_point_pct, y=total_wins)) +\n  geom_point(data=libertyseasondata, aes(x=total_three_point_pct, y=total_wins), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(x=\"Total 3-point Percentage\", y=\"Total Wins\", title=\"WNBA 2024 Season 3-Point Percentage vs. Wins\", subtitle= \"Highlighting New York Liberty's 3-point shooting impact on wins (red dot)\", caption=\"Source: Wehoop\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, let’s look into other factors like rebounds.\nWhile the New York Liberty’s three-point shooting may not set them apart, another stat certainly does—rebounds. In my second chart, I looked at total rebounds versus total wins, and the Liberty emerged as the dominant team. Their ability to consistently secure rebound, both offensively and defensively, suggests that their success isn’t built solely on shooting efficiency but also on controlling possessions. Rebounding may not always make the highlight reel, but for the Liberty, it’s clearly a core ingredient in their winning formula.\n\n\nCode\nwnbadata &lt;- load_wnba_team_box(2024) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == 2)\n\nseasondata &lt;- wnbadata |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_rebounds = sum(total_rebounds),\n    total_wins = sum(ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0))\n) |&gt;\n  filter(total_rebounds &gt; 100)\n  \nlibertydata &lt;- seasondata |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team_name == \"Liberty\"\n)\n\nggplot(seasondata, aes(x = total_rebounds, y = total_wins)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = total_rebounds, fill = team_name == \"Liberty\"),\n             shape = 21, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_size(range = c(4, 10), name = \"Total Rebounds\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"none\" = \"grey\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), guide = FALSE) +\n  labs(x=\"Total rebounds\", \n       y=\"Total wins\", \n       title=\"Rebounding To Victory\", \n        subtitle= \"Understanding the Impact of Rebounding on the Liberty's Performance\",\n        caption=\"Source: Wehoop\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so the Liberty are dominating when it comes to rebounds, let’s look at another perspective. According to my third chart, the New York Liberty had more assists than any other team in the league… except the Minnesota Lynx. That’s huge. It means the Liberty are exceeding at at setting each other up and playing as a team, which helps them get better shots and more chances to score. While their three-point percentage might not be elite, the volume and quality of those shots are heavily supported by how well they move the ball. This unselfish, fast-paced style may actually be a real driving factor in their success.\n\n\nCode\nwnbadata &lt;- load_wnba_team_box(2024) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == 2)\n\nseasondata &lt;- wnbadata |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n     total_assists = sum(assists),\n    total_wins = sum(ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0))\n) \n  \nlibertydata &lt;- seasondata |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team_name == \"Liberty\"\n)\n\nseasondatalong &lt;- seasondata |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"total\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  ) \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = seasondatalong, aes(x = team_name, weight = Value, fill = Type)\n  ) + \n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(x=\"Team\", \n        y=\"Total Wins & Assists\", title=\"Does ball movement lead to wins?\", \n        subtitle= \"The Liberty are a league leader in assists — and it’s paying off on the scoreboard.\",\n        caption=\"Source: Wehoop\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter analyzing the New York Liberty’s performance, it became clear that their success didn’t stem from their three-point shooting as I initially suspected. While their three-point shooting is barely above average, their dominance in other areas such as leading the league in rebounds and ranking second in assists, has been far more influential to their success. This analysis highlights how a well-rounded game, rather than relying on just one aspect like three-point shooting, is driving their success. Looking ahead, maintaining their rebounding percentage and assist efficiency will be crucial to sustaining their position at the top of the league in the upcoming season."

Coming in midseason, Anunoby brought more than just individual skill, he elevated the entire team’s defensive intensity, communication, and consistency.

But it’s not just about the numbers; his ability to contest shots without fouling, rotate seamlessly, and anchor the defense in high-pressure moments has transformed the Knicks’ defensive schemes. OG doesn’t just thrive in isolation defense—he makes those around him better, forcing opponents into tougher shots and disrupting offensive flow.
