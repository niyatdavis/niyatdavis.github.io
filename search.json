    "text": "The New York Liberty Dominate Three-point Shooting.\nOr at least… that’s what I thought.\nHeading into this analysis, I assumed the top team in the WNBA 2024 season had to be lights-out when it came to three-point shooting. The New York Liberty racked up wins, played with confidence, and looked unstoppable—but when I created a scatter plot comparing three-point percentage to win percentage across teams, the results surprised me. The Liberty were certainly winning, but their three-point shooting? Just barely above average. This finding challenged my assumptions and raised a bigger question: If it’s not the three-points then what’s actually driving their success?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nwnbadata &lt;- load_wnba_team_box(2024) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == 2)\n\nseasondata &lt;- wnbadata |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_threes_attempted = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted),\n    total_threes_made = sum(three_point_field_goals_made),\n    total_wins = sum(ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0))\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(total_three_point_pct = (total_threes_made/total_threes_attempted)*100) |&gt; \n  filter(total_threes_attempted &gt; 100)\n\nlibertyseasondata &lt;- seasondata |&gt;\n  filter(team_name == \"Liberty\")\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data=seasondata, aes(x=total_three_point_pct, y=total_wins)) +\n  geom_point(data=libertyseasondata, aes(x=total_three_point_pct, y=total_wins), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(x=\"Total 3-point Percentage\", y=\"Total Wins\", title=\"WNBA 2024 Season 3-Point Percentage vs. Wins\", subtitle= \"Highlighting New York Liberty's 3-point shooting impact on wins (red dot)\", caption=\"Source: Wehoop\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, let’s look into other factors like rebounds.\n\n\nCode\nwnbadata &lt;- load_wnba_team_box(2024) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == 2)\n\nseasondata &lt;- wnbadata |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_rebounds = sum(total_rebounds),\n    total_wins = sum(ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, 1, 0))\n) |&gt;\n  filter(total_rebounds &gt; 100)\n  \nlibertydata &lt;- seasondata |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team_name == \"Liberty\"\n)\n\nggplot(seasondata, aes(x = total_rebounds, y = total_wins)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = total_rebounds, fill = team_name == \"Liberty\"),\n             shape = 21, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_size(range = c(4, 10), name = \"Total Rebounds\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"grey\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), guide = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Rebounds vs. Total Wins (2024 WNBA Season)\",\n    x = \"Total Rebounds\",\n    y = \"Total Wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nWarning: The `guide` argument in `scale_*()` cannot be `FALSE`.
